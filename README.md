# Firulai Inventory Agent

Linux system analysis agent for vulnerability detection. It collects system information, installed packages, and relevant software data, then sends the inventory to Firulai/RSM.

## No-Root Installation

The external command remains the same shape as the UI-provided installer command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Redsauce/firulai-linux-agent/main/install.sh | bash -s -- <AGENT_TOKEN> <UUID>
```

If the installer is run as a regular user, it installs only for that user. If it is run as root, it asks whether to continue as a root/system install or re-run as a no-root user.

## Language

The installer accepts the locale selected by the Firulai interface:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Redsauce/firulai-linux-agent/main/install.sh | bash -s -- <AGENT_TOKEN> <UUID> --locale <LOCALE>
```

If `--locale` is not provided, the installer uses English. It does not query AppUser or Account properties. The selected locale is stored in `config.env` as `AGENT_LOCALE` and is reused by:

- `install.sh`
- `rs_agent.sh`
- `rs_agent_runner.sh`
- `uninstall.sh`

Supported Firulai preference locales are `en_US`, `es_ES`, `ca_ES`, `eu_ES`, `gl_ES`, `fr_FR`, `de_DE`, `it_IT`, `ja_JP`, and `zh_CN`. Locale aliases such as `ca`, `ca-ES`, or `ca_ES` are normalized to the supported value.

All user-facing messages in the Linux installer, agent run, automatic runner, and uninstaller must use the same selected language. When adding a new `t <key>` or `early_t <key>` message, add entries for every supported locale and run the i18n completeness check before release.

```bash
python3 scripts/check_i18n.py
bash -n install.sh rs_agent.sh rs_agent_runner.sh uninstall.sh
```

## Semantic Lifecycle

Linux uses the same receiver events as the Windows agent:

- `validateSystemInstallation` receives UUID, hostname, FQDN, locale and the
  Agent Token during installation. `available` and `same_system` continue;
  `not_found` continues silently, while `different_system` stops installation
  before local state is created when the result is available synchronously.
  Events are normally asynchronous, so Vulnwatcher owns the final decision and
  blocks inventory writes. It resolves System Client relation `1785`, then
  queries Account Details by Client `1883` and reads email property `1881`.
- `changeSystemStatus` receives UUID and `action=activate` during installation.
- `changeSystemStatus` receives UUID and `action=disconnect` during uninstall.
- `newServerData` receives the initial and recurring semantic inventory.

The Linux scripts contain no RSM property identifiers and do not call the item get/update endpoints directly. RSM mappings and stored status values belong to the receiver scripts.

## No-Root Paths

By default, user-mode installation uses:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/rs-agent/rs_agent.sh` | Main agent |
| `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/rs-agent/rs_agent_runner.sh` | Automatic runner |
| `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/rs-agent/uninstall.sh` | Uninstaller |
| `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/rs-agent/config.env` | Token and UUID |
| `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/rs-agent/inventory.json` | Last inventory |
| `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/rs-agent/state.env` | Last successful run |
| `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/rs-agent/rs-agent.log` | Log file |

Paths can be overridden with `RS_AGENT_INSTALL_DIR`, `RS_AGENT_DATA_DIR`, `RS_AGENT_LOG_FILE`, and `RS_AGENT_TMP_DIR`.

## Automatic Execution

The inventory is scheduled for `03:00` local time.

In no-root mode, the installer asks whether to use user cron or `systemd --user`.

User cron:

- Does not require root for the user crontab.
- Does not depend on an active user session.
- Requires cron/crontab installed, active, and allowed. If not, installation/activation will be attempted, requiring the root/admin password.
- If system policies block user crontabs, the automatic install cannot continue and the user is told to contact Firulai or the administrator.

```bash
crontab -l | grep rs_agent_runner
```

`systemd --user`:

- Better integration with systemd.
- Better visibility through `systemctl --user`.
- Requires linger to run without an active session. If it is not active, it will be enabled, requiring the root/admin password.

```bash
systemctl --user status rs-agent.timer
systemctl --user list-timers rs-agent.timer
```

If there is no interactive terminal, the installer uses user cron by default and validates its requirements before completing the installation.

## Manual Run

```bash
bash ~/.local/share/rs-agent/rs_agent.sh --token <AGENT_TOKEN> --uuid <UUID>
```

## Uninstall No-Root Instance

Run the uninstaller as the same user that installed the no-root agent:

```bash
bash ~/.local/share/rs-agent/uninstall.sh
```

The `~` path is resolved for the user running the command. For example, if the agent was installed by `aps-no-root-test`, run `bash /home/aps-no-root-test/.local/share/rs-agent/uninstall.sh` or switch to that user first. Running the command as `root` would look for `/root/.local/share/rs-agent/uninstall.sh`.

The no-root uninstaller only removes the current user's installation. It does not touch `/opt/rs-agent`, `/var/lib/rs-agent`, global systemd units, or an existing root installation.

## Collected Data

The agent generates a JSON inventory with:

- `system`: hostname, FQDN, UUID, distribution, kernel, architecture, timezone, and agent version.
- `hardware`: CPU model and visible disks through `lscpu` and `lsblk`.
- `components`: `dpkg`, `rpm`, `pip`, and `npm` components when available to the user.
- `packages`: source packages derived from `dpkg-query` on Debian/Ubuntu.

On a normal Debian/Ubuntu system, an unprivileged user should be able to list packages with `dpkg-query`. Differences from root mode are expected mainly in restricted commands, inaccessible paths, Python/Node packages visible through `PATH`, or hardware information restricted by the environment.

## Comparing Root And No-Root Results

For a server that already has the root agent:

1. Keep the existing root installation untouched.
2. Create a normal test user without sudo or special groups.
3. Create a separate test UUID in Firulai/RSM.
4. Log in as that user and run the no-root installer.
5. Compare the root inventory with the no-root inventory locally and in RSM.
6. Review counts for `dpkg`, `rpm`, `pip`, `npm`, hardware, and empty fields.

Useful commands:

```bash
id
dpkg-query -W | wc -l
cat ~/.local/state/rs-agent/inventory.json
grep -o '"manager":"dpkg"' ~/.local/state/rs-agent/inventory.json | wc -l
grep -o '"manager":"pip"' ~/.local/state/rs-agent/inventory.json | wc -l
grep -o '"manager":"npm"' ~/.local/state/rs-agent/inventory.json | wc -l
```

## Requirements

- Linux
- bash 4+
- curl
- `mktemp`
- `flock` (`util-linux`)
- `systemd --user` or `cron` for automatic execution
